Quest now has a fully functional transcript feature.

### The Commands

- SCRIPT
- TRANSCRIPT
- SCRIPT ON
- TRANSCRIPT ON
- ENABLE SCRIPT
- ENABLE TRANSCRIPT

Any of these commands will enable the transcript feature.  If it is already enabled, Quest will print, "The transcript is already enabled."

---
- SCRIPT OFF
- TRANSCRIPT OFF
- DISABLE SCRIPT
- DISABLE TRANSCRIPT

Any of these commands will disable the transcript.

---
- SHOW SCRIPT
- VIEW SCRIPT
- SHOW TRANSCRIPT
- VIEW TRANSCRIPT

Any of these will display the transcript in a dialog popup, with a 'Print' button included.

---
If using the desktop player (as of the upcoming 5.8.0 release), transcripts will be saved to the directory "Documents\Quest Transcripts".  This file will be in the HTML format.  When double-clicked, the transcript should open in the user's default browser.

CSS is added to align everything to the left.  The background is set to white and the color to black.  Be aware that the transcript may have a few strange-looking areas, depending on what all HTML and CSS code you have in a game.  (We are fixing every issue we come across, but it is hard to foresee what code a Quest game may include!)
