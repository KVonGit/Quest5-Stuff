It's a little sloppy,but it seems to be functional.

**CoreEditorGame.aslx** lines 988-991

```xml
    <tab>
      <caption>[EditorGameAttributes]</caption>
      <advanced/>
      <!-- <desktop/>-->
```

I just commented out the `<desktop/>` bit, which tells the editor it's for the desktop editor only.
