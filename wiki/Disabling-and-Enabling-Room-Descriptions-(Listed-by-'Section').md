There are four, individual attributes on the game during play which effect the order of each of these:
<table style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>
<tr>
<th style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>Displayed text</th>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'><b>Attribute name</b></td>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'><b>Default value (integer)</b></td>
</tr>
<th style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>Room Name:</th>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>autodescription_youarein</td>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>Exits List:</th>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>autodescription_youcango</td>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>Objects List:</th>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>autodescription_youcansee</td>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>Description:</th>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>autodescription_description</td>
<td style='padding:6px;border:1px solid;'>4</td>
</tr>
</table>



**You can set any one of these to 0 to turn them off during play.**

---

Example:
```
// First, backup the current setting:
game.autodescription_description_backup = game.autodescription_description
// Now, change the value to 0, turning it off:
game.autodescription_description = 0
```

That turns off the actual room description (the text you enter under the description of the room).

To turn it back on:
```
// Check to see if the setting has been backed up.
if (HasAttribute(game, "autodescription_description_backup")){
  // The setting has been backed up, so we use that attribute to reset it.
  game.autodescription_description = game.autodescription_description_backup
}
else {
  // The setting has not been backed up, so we set it to Quest's default value.
  game.autodescription_description = 4
}
// Now, make sure it is on. If it is 0 at this point, set to Quest's default value.
if(autodescription_description = 0){
  //  It is still disabled, so set to Quest's default value.
  game.autodescription_description = 4
}
  
```

---
To turn off the exits list:
```
// First, backup the current setting:
game.autodescription_youcango_backup = game.autodescription_youcango
// Now, change the value to 0, turning it off:
game.autodescription_youcango = 0
```

I'd be leery of turning off the objects list, but I'm sure everyone can see how to manipulate it now.


---
To turn off everything which is automatically generated by Quest (the room name, the objects list, and the exits list, but **NOT THE ROOM DESCRIPTIONS YOU HAVE ENTERED FOR ANY ROOMS**):

<h4 style='color:red'><b>I advise against this.  If you disable the automatically generated Objects List, and the player drops something, that object will more than likely be lost forever _unless the Places and Objects pane is visible_.</b></h4>

```
game.autodescription = false
```

---
To turn them back on:
```
game.autodescription = true
```
