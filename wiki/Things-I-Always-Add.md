# Things I add to every parser game

- TURN COUNT (all games should keep track of turns!)

- SCORE command (even if there is no scoring, it says so when the player enters SCORE)

- AVLib (it's much better than Quest's built-in ```play sound``` script)

- ClockLib (all games should keep track of the time!)

- NpcLib (okay... maybe I only add this to 9 out of 10 games, but it should still be included by default)
